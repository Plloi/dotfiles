# Sample Maid rules file -- some ideas to get you started.
#
# To use, remove ".sample" from the filename, and modify as desired.  Test using:
#
#     maid clean -n
#
# **NOTE:** It's recommended you just use this as a template; if you run these rules on your machine without knowing
# what they do, you might run into unwanted results!
#
# Don't forget, it's just Ruby!  You can define custom methods and use them below:
#
#     def magic(*)
#       # ...
#     end
#
# If you come up with some cool tools of your own, please send me a pull request on GitHub!  Also, please consider sharing your rules with others via [the wiki](https://github.com/benjaminoakes/maid/wiki).
